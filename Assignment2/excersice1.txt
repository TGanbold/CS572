1.  setImmediate fires at event loop's check phase. So if we need functionality right after
    I/O callback or poll(incomming connection, data) phase, we use setImmediate instead of setTimeout

2.  process.nextTick's operation goes to nextTickQueue / priorityQueue®.
    setImmediate's operation goes to check phase's callback queue.

    process.nextTick fires after current operation, regardless of event loop's phase.
    event loop continue only if priorityQueue® is empty.

    setImmediate wait until it's phase to be fired in event loop.
